downloading uv 0.9.9 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of torchvision==0.23.0+cu121 and your
      project depends on torchvision==0.23.0+cu121, we can conclude that your
      project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: `torchvision` was found on https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121,
      but not at the requested version (torchvision==0.23.0+cu121). A
      compatible version may be available on a subsequent index (e.g.,
      https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only consider versions
      that are published on the first index that contains a given package, to
      avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted,
      use `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from
      all indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.

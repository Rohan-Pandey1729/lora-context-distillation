  ╰─▶ Because mergekit==0.1.4 depends on pydantic>=2.10.6,<2.11.dev0
      and vllm==0.11.0 depends on pydantic>=2.11.7, we can conclude that
      mergekit==0.1.4 and vllm==0.11.0 are incompatible.
      And because your project depends on mergekit==0.1.4 and vllm==0.11.0, we
      can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

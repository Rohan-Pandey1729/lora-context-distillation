downloading uv 0.9.10 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only the following versions of vllm are available:
          vllm<=0.10.0
          vllm==0.10.1
          vllm==0.10.1.1
          vllm==0.10.2
          vllm==0.11.0
          vllm==0.11.1
      and vllm==0.11.1 depends on torch==2.9.0, we can conclude that
      vllm>0.11.0 depends on torch==2.9.0.
      And because vllm>=0.10.2,<=0.11.0 depends on torch==2.8.0 and
      torch==2.7.1, we can conclude that vllm>=0.10.0 depends on one of:
          torch==2.7.1
          torch==2.8.0
          torch==2.9.0

      And because only torch<=2.5.1+cu121 is available and your project
      depends on vllm>=0.10.0, we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: `torch` was found on https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121, but
      not at the requested version (all of:
          torch==2.7.1
          torch==2.8.0
          torch==2.9.0
      ). A compatible version may be available on a subsequent index (e.g.,
      https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only consider versions
      that are published on the first index that contains a given package, to
      avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted,
      use `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from
      all indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.
